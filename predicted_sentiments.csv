ive had lots tablets in past mostly from samsung line my first amazon fire so i want write review for others who have never tried one these at time written alexa had not been added tabletfirst while device runs android type operating system amazon puts its own spin on operating system i dont feel like im using android feels different me it doesnt have same level customization android users have come appreciate being said if you amazon prime member device has been tailored be your content entertainment machine its simply fun way consume your magazines books etcthere onscreen buttons on bottom device middle button immediately takes you your home screen button left acts as sort back button it also lets me get rid my keyboard when i dont need it on screen its open button right super important it took me couple days realize what it does square shaped button what you press you see what apps you have open it lets you switch between apps it also lets you see which apps you have open close them out you can close them by pressing x button in corner window appears by touching app window swiping right if you leave all those apps open you never close them youll drain your battery make sure you use little square button clear your appsthe device has several menus you swipe left view first you start with your home screen you literally can stay on screen do anything you need do on tablet all your apps housed here you swipe up view all them tablet comes with several apps preinstalled such as slik amazons own internet browser audible good reads amazon app store weather app etc you can go amazon app store download other apps such as twitter facebook etc you can combine apps on page into folders you just drag one app another app folder appears made my home screen much more manageable you can change size font on home screen from normal large small in device settings feature doesnt necessarily increase size font within your apps however i believe it only changes font on your main screensif you have magazine newspaper subscription connected your device when you have new issues it will show up at top your home page screen under heading new items device comes with free month subscription washington post youll see under new items when you initially activate your tabletyou can change wallpaper on screen use one your own photos you can do through settings menu on device if you want use one your own photos however you need either take it on device move it into amazons photos app which cloudbased appso far i havent found way effectively use different photo management app will let me change my wallpaper im not crazy about amazon photo app i found it annoying move my photos from my phone into amazons cloud just so i could view them on my tablet being said im not planning take photos on device i just wanted few pet photos on there ability change my wallpaperbeyond home screen you can swipe right view your other screen they prearranged be books videos games shop apps music audiobooks newstand all those screens connected your amazon account for example if you have kindle books youve already purchased they automatically will appear under books menu your magazines newspaper subscriptions will appear under newstand menu there doesnt seem be way change order menu pages bugs me its not end world theres also one menu left home menu its recent page it shows you what youve received looked at on tablet i never use it it might be handy for some peopleone my favorite features tablet amazons on deck capability if youre amazon prime member amazon will periodically download video your device it thinks you might like items dont count against your preinstalled memory they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full you can turn off on deck feature if you dont like it ive been content with video playback capability isnt my major use device images look fine audio ok ill talk more about speakers later my other favorite feature tablet viewing magazine content through newstand ive tried magazines on here they all look gorgeous now i can always have my magazines with me so if im stuck at airport at doctors office i always have them one my regular magazines includes free digital version magazine for free i just had connect my account device allows me download back issues magazine for as long as ive had account my other magazine didnt include digital edition so i canceled print edition it switched digital version it inexpensive magazine anyway there several magazines you can try free for days on device i did with third magazine decided keep it for year viewing magazines on gadget pleasurethe kindle fire doesnt come with google play store installed you can side load it device without rooting it breaking your warranty you can google find instructions do its not difficult do if youre fairly comfortable with technology it probably took me minutes most apps i wanted in amazon store there handful i had paid for through google play only way i could have them go back access store they have worked fine so far i despise keyboard amazon preinstalled on device there no lines between letters on keyboard i suppose it designed be better for swyping through keys i hate it i fixed problem by going google play downloading new keyboard it pretty easy problem solve so i cant complainapps connecting internet can be little slow load on device compared my other gadgets generally doesnt bother me if you using tablet replace your personal laptop however might drive you crazy screen on device isnt bad if i compare it my fancy phone its not as shape when you think about price device compared my smartphone screen outstandingthe speakers ok there two them located on bottom screen i wont say they fantastic they arent in my opinion they fine for watching youtube television show they not ok for listening music if you audiophile you can make it little better by downloading different music app instead relying on preinstall app still your music will sound tinny being said you can always connect your tablet bluetooth speaker use pair headphones etcthis device wasnt made for taking pictures it has front back camera they arent designed be spectacular im not using themi find device little difficult hold in my hands i think thats partly because size partly because it feels very slick also i do have some hand problems similar someone who has carpal tunnel syndrome i think it will be easier handle once my case arrives im still waiting for it im greatly enjoying device its simply fun use tablet there weaknesses come with lower price tag you legitimately get lot bang for your buck particularly if you regularly use amazon services if you dont typically use amazon you just looking for tablet for viewing internet youre looking for low price tag device may be ok for you,Positive,Positive,Positive

alexa show purchased replace another much older device while show good device it lacking in some aspects i had in older device im not sure if im missing it in show i able get internet cameras on older device such as san diego zoo elephants you cant get on show while certainly not deal breaker it fun watch setup pretty straight forward easy it good aspect we can talk device it knows what we want certain extent it very literal at times you have make sure you have exact code words you get something other than what you want such as play start open i use it as alarm clock it quite easy set up same time for my week it would be little more difficult if you have work one weekend day week then more other combination you would have set up several different alarms one for each day as far as i can see some alarm sound choices bit alarming i dont really want be terrified awake each day i found one mellow at moderate sound level works well it would be nice be able add your own alarm sounds so you could have it customized what youd like i dont see yet anywhere another thing about alarm if you try dismiss it touch screen wrong way it puts alarm into snooze mode instead turning it off if you tell it dismiss alarm it works fine there times id rather not say anything at time day just dismiss it with swipe which possible very sensitive if you miss here comes snooze just little things may get fixed in future with enough feedback from customers some may not effect people as much as some people who have more impact with particular anomaly i am thinking getting thermostat hooks it so i can monitor change heat cooling in future at time hoping works well when it arrivesit will be nice raise temp degree in cold winter without having get out warmth bed all in all id say its good emerging technology needs little work considering type thing science fiction not too long ago its kind where heading,Positive,Positive,Positive
